When initially loaded the NN is idle and not training.

Example has several sliders that allow you to adjust parameters of the NN

* Hidden Nodes Slider - Adjusts the number of hidden nodes in the NN.
* Reset NN - Resets the NN with the Hidden Nodes Value
* Training Rate Slider - Adjusts the training rate
* Train count per loop slider - Adjusts the number of training cycles to perform per loop of draw() or 'Train One Ittr' button
* Train One Ittr button - Does One iteration Loop of training
